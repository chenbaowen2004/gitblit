WAR Data Location
By default, Gitblit WAR stores all data (users, settings, repositories, etc) in ${contextFolder}/WEB-INF/data. This is fine for a quick setup, but there are many reasons why you don't want to keep your data within the webapps folder of your servlet container. Specifying an alternate baseFolder also allows for simple upgrades in the future.

Choose a location that is writeable by your servlet container!

After you configure baseFolder and restart your container, Gitblit will copy the contents of the WEB-INF/data folder to your specified baseFolder IF the file ${baseFolder}/gitblit.properties does not already exist. This allows you to get going with minimal fuss.

Specifying baseFolder via GITBLIT_HOME
You can specify GITBLIT_HOME either as an environment variable or as a -DGITBLIT_HOME JVM system property.

Specifying baseFolder via web.xml
You may specify an external location for your data by directly editing WEB-INF/web.xml and manipulating the baseFolder env-entry. Your servlet container may be smart enough to recognize the change and to restart Gitblit.

Specifying baseFolder via JNDI
This is a better way to configure your baseFolder because it survives WAR redeploys or deployments of new versions. These directions assume you are running Tomcat as your container, other containers may have different ways to specify global JNDI environment entries.

Open TOMCAT_HOME/conf/context.xml
Insert an Environment node within the Context node.
<Environment name="baseFolder" type="java.lang.String" value="c:/projects/git/gitblit/data" override="false" />
